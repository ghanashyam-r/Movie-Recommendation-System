Movie Recommendation System

Purpose:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust movie recommendation system that enhances user experience by accurately suggesting movies
based on their preferences. Leveraging techniques in machine learning and data
processing, the system aims to deliver personalized recommendations with improved accuracy and speed.

Scope:
The movie recommendation system is a crucial component of streaming platforms, serving to personalize the user experience, optimize content discovery,
and maximize user engagement. By employing advanced machine learning algorithms, the system tailors movie suggestions based on individual viewing history and preferences, alleviating decision fatigue and fostering a positive viewing experience. This not only enhances user satisfaction but also contributes to
platform revenue by retaining subscribers and attracting new ones. Additionally, the system provides valuable data insights for data-driven decision-making,
helping platforms stay competitive in a crowded market. Overall, the movie recommendation system is a key tool in simplifying content navigation, increasing
